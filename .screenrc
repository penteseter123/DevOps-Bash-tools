# Reload .screenrc without restarting:
#
# Ctrl-a :source $HOME/.screenrc

startup_message off

defscrollback 20000

# enables monitor to notify of change in backgrounded panes (default: off)
# do not enable - causes flickering ocassionally noticeable, but really awful when running welcome
#defmonitor on

crlf off
vbell off

# default: off - echos command on every new pane
#verbose on

#version

# redundant vs caption - ends up with 2 lines of the same stuff
# caption is better when splitting
#hardstatus string "..."

# called only during Power Detach (C-a D D), ie. a detach that sends a HUP signal to screen's parent, results in a logout from the parent shell
pow_detach_msg "Screen session of \$LOGNAME \$:cr:\$:nl:ended."

# set pw to prevent root attaching - if no crypted pw, initially prompts twice for pw
#password [<crypted_pw>]

#altscreen on

# don't use this, wastes a line at bottom of terminal
# and if setting string you end up with 2 status lines at bottom since 'caption always' is set further down
#hardstatus on
#hardstatus alwayslastline

#term screen-256color

# ============================================================================ #
# default:
# shell $SHELL
#
# dash prefix starts a login shell
# shell -$SHELL
#
# must be full path because script which relies on $SHELL which is set by this
#
# might be a touch expensive as profile logins may do expensive rare initialization operations
# instead rely on inheriting the profile environment by this point
#shell -/bin/bash
shell /bin/bash

# ============================================================================ #
# defaults to "Unnamed" otherwise
# shelltitle ""
#
# Auto-Title - makes title the first word after the "$ " prompt or sets it to the thing on the other side of | which is simply blank
#
# Requires that PS1 have a null shelltitle escape sequence to be able to capture this
#
# causes marginal flickering
#shelltitle '$ |'
#
# change prompt to use > instead of $
# the space before the > is useful to distinguish the PS1 prompt from the PS4 prompt
# doesn't work when using 'screen -t blah', can't find a way of reactivating it on the already open window, new windows in the screen are fine though
shelltitle ' > |'

# ============================================================================ #

# bind    - prefixes ctrl-a
# bindkey - plain key sequence

# to unbind a key, run the bind again with no command

# no longer exists - left as example
#bindkey ^f screen -t Tech-Stable ssh tech-stable.harisekhon.com

# ctrl-a ctrl-x
#bind ^x focus up

# ctrl-a `
bind ` focus up

# Mac key in siilar position to PC `
# doesn't work when testing 'ctrl-a ยง'
# ignore since that key is slightly awkward and just use the up arrow set below
#bind ยง focus up

#bindkey ^` focus up
# ctrl-a <up_arrow>
# ctrl-a <down_arrow>
bindkey "^A^[OA" focus up
bindkey "^A^[OB" focus down

bindkey -k k1 select 0  # F1 = screen 0
bindkey -k k2 select 1  # F2 = screen 1
bindkey -k k3 select 2  # F3 = screen 2
bindkey -k k4 select 3  # F4 = screen 3
bindkey -k k5 select 4  # F5 = screen 4
bindkey -k k6 select 5  # F6 = screen 5
bindkey -k k7 select 6  # F7 = screen 6
bindkey -k k8 copy      # F8 = scrollback mode
bindkey -k k9 title     # F9 = change title
bindkey -k k; windowlist -b # F10 = windowlist
bindkey -k F2 next      # F12 = next
bindkey -k F1 prev      # F11 = previous

# ============================================================================ #

# %=       - pads space
# .        - sets background transparent
# %{-}     - pops one colour off the colour change stack to restore the last colour, useful for consistency
# $LOGNAME - <user> - needs double quotes
#
# can use `` the same as in shell

# Hari's style:
#
# transparent magenta <hostname> boldGreen <windows_before_current> boldBlue<num>*<flags> <title> <pop> windows_after_current <pad> boldRed <load> white <24HR>:<secs> <Day> <dd>/<Mon>/<YYYY>
caption always "%{= .G}[ %{= .m}%H %{-}| %-Lw%?%{r}[%{B}%n%f* %t%{-}]%{-}%?%+Lw %= | %{= .R}%l %{-}| %{= .d}%c:%s %D %d/%M/%Y %{-}]"
#       splitonly (default - only shows during splits - but we want always to replace hardline and standardize look with or without splits)
